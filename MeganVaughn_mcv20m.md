 From the Basics of GitHub overview, I learned the difference between $${\color{purple} Git}$$ and $${\color{pink} GitHub}$$.
- **$${\color{purple} Git}$$** is a tool for easily tracking changes in your code, whereas GitHub is an interface that uses Git.
- **$${\color{pink} GitHub}$$** is a visualization tool for Git projects.
  
I also learned about repositories and **$${\color{orange} committing}$$** and **$${\color{green} pushing}$$**.
- **$${\color{lightblue} Repositories}$$** are folders for projects that contain all the files and revision histories.
- **$${\color{orange} Committing}$$** and  **$${\color{green} Pushing}$$** are how the changes made to the files are added to the repository.
- **$${\color{lightgreen} Commit messages}$$** are helpful to let yourself or other collaborators know what was changed in the file, for example, a README file.
