<span style="color:purple">From the Basics of GitHub overview, I learned the difference between Git and GitHub.</span>

- Git is a tool for easily tracking changes in your code, whereas GitHub is an interface that uses Git.
- GitHub is a visualization tool for Git projects.
  
I also learned about repositories and committing and pushing.
- Repositories are folders for projects that contain all the files and revision histories.
- Committing and pushing are how the changes made to the files are added to the repository.
- Commit messages are helpful to let yourself or other collaborators know what was changed in the file, for example, a README file.
